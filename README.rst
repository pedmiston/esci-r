Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals in R (ESCI-R)
===========================================================

This repository is a collection of apps based on Geoff Cumming's excellent ESCI software. The software is primarily educational, and is described in detail in Cummings book "Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis". I decided to undertake porting ESCI (originally in Excel) to R for a number of reasons, primarily to learn by doing.
